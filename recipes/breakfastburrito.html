        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> 
            A breakfast burrito is a savory and filling meal, 
            perfect for starting the day with energy. 
            Wrapped in a warm flour tortilla, 
            it usually contains scrambled eggs, 
            crispy bacon or sausage, melted cheese, and potatoes,
            all seasoned with spices to enhance the flavor. 
            Optional ingredients like avocado, salsa, or 
            sour cream can add creaminess and a touch of freshness.
            The combination of soft eggs, crunchy meat, 
            and gooey cheese makes for a satisfying bite every time.
