        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> 
            A Caesar salad is a classic, crisp, and flavorful dish, known for its rich,
            creamy dressing and satisfying combination of textures. Made with fresh romaine lettuce,
            crunchy croutons, and grated Parmesan cheese, it's often topped with grilled chicken 
            for a heartier version. The signature Caesar dressing is a savory blend of ingredients 
            like olive oil, egg, garlic, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies, giving 
            the salad its distinctive umami flavor. This simple yet indulgent salad is perfect 
            as a side dish or a light main course.
